To run these experiments, in MATLAB, navigate to the folder of interest which contains a main file, and type Experiment.Run() in the command line.
The results will be produced in a time-stamped copy of the folder.

Note that in order to run the experiment folders in 1ParameterSensitivity, the folders "Code" and "Splits" need to be copied into the experiment folder you wish to run. 
These were moved outside the experiment folders to save space.
